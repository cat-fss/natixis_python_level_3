# 🐍 Natixis Python Level 3

## 📚 Course Overview

This advanced Python course is designed for students who have already mastered intermediate programming concepts and want to expand their skills toward object-oriented programming (OOP), modular design, and interactive application development.
Students will learn to structure Python code professionally, understand reusability and abstraction, manage projects using Git and GitHub, and create Streamlit applications for data-driven interfaces.

# 📋 Course Structure (Intermediate Python - Level 3)

## 🚀 Class 1: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

### 🗝️ Core OOP Concepts
- What is Object-Oriented Programming?
- Benefits of OOP (Reusability, Modularity, Maintainability)
- Python Classes
- Attributes
- Methods
- Objects

---

## 🔐 Class 2: OOP - Design and Modularity

### 🧠 OOP Principles
- **Encapsulation**: Protecting data with access control
- **Abstraction**: Hiding implementation details
- **Inheritance**: Reusing and extending functionality
- **Polymorphism**: Designing flexible interfaces
- Modularity: Organizing code into reusable components

---

## 🧰 Class 3: Modules, Version Control, and Streamlit

### 🧩 Python Modules
- Installing and importing external modules
- Commonly used libraries (`random`, `datetime`, `math`, etc.)
- Creating your own Python module
- Understanding packages (`__init__.py`)

### 🔄 Version Control with Git & GitHub
- Why version control matters
- Core concepts (repository, commit, branch, merge, pull request)
- GitHub basics (creating a repo, pushing code)
- Essential commands: `git init`, `git add`, `git commit`, `git push`, `git pull`, `git status`, `git branch`, etc.

### 💻 Introduction to Streamlit
- What is Streamlit and why use it?
- Installing and launching a Streamlit app
- Creating basic components
- Connecting Streamlit with data (CSV, Pandas DataFrame)
- Deploying Streamlit apps (intro)

---

## 🚀 Class 4: Final Project

### 💡 Project Description

Students will apply all concepts learned throughout the course to design and build a complete Streamlit application. The project will demonstrate:

- OOP design: use of classes, attributes, and methods
- Modularity: structured code using modules and packages
- Version control: GitHub repository with commits and documentation
- Visualization and interactivity using Streamlit components


## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this course, students will be able to:
- Design and implement Python classes using OOP principles (encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction).
- Write modular and maintainable Python applications using packages and custom modules.
- Use Git and GitHub to manage project versions and collaborate effectively.
- Create interactive and data-driven web applications with Streamlit.

## ✅ Prerequisites

Before taking this course, students should be familiar with:

- Installing Python and setting up the working environment (IDE, libraries)
- Python syntax, fundamentals, and data types (strings, lists, sets, arrays, dictionaries)
- Control structures (`if`, `for`, `while`)
- Functions and lambda expressions
- Comprehensions and generators
- Basic `pandas usage`:
  - Creating and accessing DataFrames
  - Reading/importing datasets
  - Basic data analysis (max, min, mean, median, mode, percentiles)
  - Filtering, adding, removing, and modifying rows and columns
  - Handling missing values (NA)
- Data visualization with matplotlib/seaborn
- File I/O and basic data manipulation
